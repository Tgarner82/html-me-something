<h2>This is my LC101 Web Page</h2>
<p>Hello my name is Tyrone Garner II and my Web Page will tell you a little about me. </p><br>
<p>I am currently working as a Security Supervisor at Lumiere Casino and Hotels, but soon will be leaving there to work for the IRS.<p>
<p>I started my journey as a developer back in 2015 and am pursuing an Associates of Science in Software Development.</p>
<p>The above links are assignments I have done in a previous HTML class, but they are not working at the moment.</p>
<p>Click the Resume link for a download of my current resume.<p/>
